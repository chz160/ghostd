**Ghostd** *(Working Title)*

### Genre
Terminal-Themed Tactical Auto-Battler / Strategy Sim

### Target Platform
- Android
- iOS

### Core Gameplay Summary
Ghostd is a proximity-based mobile auto-battler where players craft modular rogue AIs and deploy them against other hackers within physical range. Using geofencing technology, battles trigger when players come within 100 meters of each other—turning real-world encounters into digital duels. Each victory salvages code fragments to evolve your AI, building reputation in both local territories and the global network.

### Unique Selling Points (USP)
- **Real-world proximity battles**: Face-to-face PvP like trading card games, but digital—battles trigger within 100m range
- **Deep AI customization** through modular Core, Behavior, and Augment system—thousands of combinations
- **Privacy-first multiplayer**: Choose visibility modes (Precise/Fuzzy/Ghost) to control how others find you
- **Minimalist hacker aesthetic** using a sleek, touch-friendly terminal UI—no typing required
- **Fast tactical battles**: 30–90 seconds, perfect for quick encounters or extended sessions

### Target Audience
- Mobile gamers who miss local multiplayer experiences (like Nintendo DS battles)
- Strategy fans seeking real-world social gaming without AR gimmicks
- Cyberpunk enthusiasts and fans of hacker culture aesthetics
- Competitive players who value skill-based PvP with tangible, in-person stakes
- Privacy-conscious gamers wanting multiplayer without invasive tracking

### Status
- Solo developer
- GDD and core loop defined
- MVP scoped for development
- Concept assets and narrative tone locked in
