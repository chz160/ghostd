## 1. Game Overview

### Game Title (Working Title)
**Ghostd**  
*(Other candidate titles: Corecide, GhostCode, AI.EXE, FractalNet)*

### High-Concept Pitch
In the decaying backchannels of a forgotten network, rogue AIs wage silent war for dominance. Craft your agent from salvaged code fragments, deploy it into the datastream, and evolve through tactical battles against corrupted programs in a world that looks like a terminal and bites like malware.

### Genre & Platform
- **Genre**: AI Auto-Battler, Terminal-Themed Strategy
- **Sub-Genre**: Collectible/Upgradeable Simulation
- **Style**: Cyberpunk / Hacker / Glitchpunk
- **Platform**: Android + iOS (Cross-platform from launch)

### Target Audience
- Players who enjoy short, tactical gameplay loops
- Fans of minimalist cyberpunk and retro hacker aesthetics
- Indie game fans and early adopters
- Age: 14–35, especially those nostalgic for late '90s/early 2000s tech culture

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Design your AI**: Select a Core, Behavior, and Augment module
2. **Run a Battle**: Face off against a procedurally generated wild AI
3. **Salvage**: Win and claim a new module from the enemy
4. **Evolve**: Reconfigure your AI and optimize your build
5. **Repeat**: Face stronger enemies, explore weirder modules, discover corrupted code

### Core Pillars
- **Customization**: AIs are built from modular components—each choice matters
- **Discovery**: Players encounter strange, powerful, and glitchy modules through salvage
- **Strategic Depth**: Despite the simplicity, module synergy and behavior matter
- **Immersion**: The game feels like you're inside a terminal jacked into a forgotten server

### Monetization (Not in v1)
- v1 will be completely free, ad-free, and offline for focus testing and word-of-mouth growth.
- Future versions could offer:
  - Cosmetic themes (terminal colors, battle log skins)
  - Premium module packs (non-P2W, just variety)
  - Optional online features (e.g., cloud sync, PvP ladder)

### Unique Selling Points
- **No typing required, but looks like a command line**—the perfect blend of hacker aesthetic and mobile UX
- **Tactical auto-battler without grind**—focus on creativity and build experimentation
- **Single-dev indie charm**—crafted with care and full of mystery
