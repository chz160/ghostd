# GHOSTD Module System

## Overview
The module system in GHOSTD allows players to customize their AI by combining three types of modules:
- **Core Modules**: Define base stats (HP, Power) and architecture
- **Behavior Modules**: Determine combat patterns and decision-making
- **Augment Modules**: Provide special abilities and effects

## Module Types

### Core Modules
- Alpha Core: Fast neural architecture with high processing power
- Beta Core: Resilient quantum architecture with high health
- Gamma Core: Powerful grid architecture with balanced stats
- Delta Core: Stable distributed architecture focused on survival
- Epsilon Core: Experimental core with unique properties

### Behavior Modules
- Aggressive Protocol: High damage, low defense combat style
- Defensive Matrix: Tank-focused with damage reduction
- Balanced Algorithm: Versatile combat approach
- Chaotic Subroutine: Unpredictable with random effects
- Adaptive Framework: Learns and improves during battle

### Augment Modules
- Overclock: Temporarily boost all stats
- Shield Projector: Generate defensive barriers
- Data Leech: Steal power from enemies
- Glitch Field: Cause random malfunctions
- Echo Chamber: Amplify ability effects

## Accessing Modules

1. From the Main Terminal, select option [2] MODULE LAB
2. Choose either:
   - [1] AI ASSEMBLY - Combine modules into a complete AI
   - [2] MODULE DATABASE - Browse all available modules

## Module Rarity
- Common (White): Basic modules with standard stats
- Rare (Blue): Enhanced modules with better modifiers
- Epic (Purple): Powerful modules with unique properties
- Legendary (Orange): Extremely rare modules with exceptional abilities
- Corrupted (Red): Unstable modules with high risk/reward

## Tips
- Experiment with different module combinations
- Consider synergies between module abilities
- Watch for corrupted modules - they're powerful but unstable
- Some modules work better with specific core architectures
